financial institutions operate in an evolving regulatory environment where privacy and data protectin requirements frequently change acroos jusisdictions.
curently, regulatory updates, business impact assessments, and privacy risk tracking are often managed across disconnected tools 
  and teams. this limits leadership's ability to obtain a consolidate, enterperizse-wide view of regulatory exposure, 
  emerging risk trends,  and governance gaps.
this project simulate a regulatory intelligence and horizontal privacy risk platform designed to:
  - centralize regulatory and privacy risk data
  - map regulatory changes to cross-functional business impact
  - apply standardized risk metric and executive thresholds
  - support executive, CRO, and audit committe reporting through automated insights and dashboards.
