# Logical Model

the platform is designed around the leadership between regulatory reguirements, business units, and privacy/ compliance risks.

## Core Relationships
- a regulatory requirement can be associated with multiple risks.
- a risk belongs to one business unit and one risk owner.
- a risk can have multiple review records over tiem to support governance and audit tracking.

## Design Rationale
this model enable horizontal risk analysis by allowing leadership to trace how a single regulatory change impacts multiple business units and operational areas while maintaining clear ownership and compliance accoountability.
